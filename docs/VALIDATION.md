# Native implementation validation

This log concerns the native application. Browser-prototype checks in design/QA.md do not prove capture functionality.

## Native application shell — 2026-09-16

- Environment: Apple Silicon, macOS 26.6.2, Xcode 26.6, Swift 6.3.3.
- SwiftPM debug compilation passed; generated bundle executable is Mach-O arm64.
- App Info.plist passed plutil validation; bundle identifier is com.luyao618.Scriber.
- Local ad-hoc app signature passed codesign --verify --strict.
- App launched through Launch Services and running Scriber process was observed.
- Build script refuses to overwrite an already-running Scriber bundle; guard verified.
- Native view rendered using SwiftUI ImageRenderer and visually inspected. This is an offscreen render of the application view, not a desktop screenshot or proof of menu bar interaction.
- Automated native GUI connector timed out and then was unavailable in the current tool inventory. Actual menu bar/mode-switch confirmation was requested from the user and remains pending.

## Outstanding acceptance

Real recording is not implemented at this milestone. Dual-source capture, live meters, permissions, file outputs, screen selection, device changes, recovery, real 8-hour audio / 2-hour video tests, and final native GUI validation remain outstanding.
